Swagger UI
==========

Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically 
generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API. Because Swagger UI has no 
dependencies, you can host it in any server environment, or on your local machine.

How to Use It
-------------

```bash
wget https://github.com/downloads/wordnik/swagger-ui/swagger-ui-1.0.zip
unzip swagger-ui-1.0.zip
open swagger-ui-1.0/index.html
```

How to Improve It
-----------------

First, create your own fork of [wordnik/swagger-ui](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui)

To hack on swagger-ui, you'll need ruby. Then..

```bash
# Install the middleman gem:
'gem install middleman'

# Copy spec-files directory from swagger-codegen to 'swagger-ui/source' folder

# Start up a development server on http://localhost:4567
'middleman server'

# Edit the files in `/source`
# Then when you're ready to build, run:
'middleman build'

# You can change host to ajax request in file swagger-service.js (line 255) for test it locally
'url = location.protocol + "//" + location.host + window.apiBasePath + url + _queryParams;'
```
